/**
 * @file
 * A dynamically-resizing array (a.k.a. vector)
 *
 * The vector is exposed as an "abstract data type" whose implementation details
 * are encapsulated in this module's implementation file. This way, callers
 * can't depend on those details directly. Callers also can't access data
 * members directly (and, in so doing, corrupt the integrity of a struct), and
 * this module can thus guarantee the integrity of the caller's struct
 * instances. For example, it's impossible for the caller to mess their vectors'
 * integrity up by, say, directly changing the struct member that indicates how
 * many elements a vector holds without adding or removing any elements. This
 * being C, they can still find a way to manipulate a vector objects' memory
 * directly, like by applying offsets to pointers they receive to memory within
 * the vector (like when accessing vector elements). The encapsulation just
 * makes determined callers go out of their way to do so.
 *
 * Vector elements are "generic", retrievable as `void` pointers to be cast back
 * into their underlying type, and are stored contiguously. A vector can only be
 * used with elements of the same size that the vector was created with via
 * `Vec_new()`. Elements are appended to the vector via `Vec_append()`.
 * Functions which add elements to the vector enforce a weak "type check" by
 * taking the size of the element to be added as an argument.
 *
 * Element storage is handled automatically, expanding via reallocation as
 * necessary when elements are added. Since reallocations are costly, the
 * `Vec_new()` function reserves capacity for a minimum number of elements up
 * front, to eliminate automatic reallocations up to that number of elements.
 * The number of elements in a vector is queried via `Vec_count()`.
 *
 * Complexity (efficiency) of common vector operations (assuming `realloc()` is
 * O(n)):
 *     - Random access is constant, O(1).
 *     - Insertion or removal of elements at the end is amortized constant,
 *       O(1)+, since there may be occasional, and linear (which is greater than
 *       constant and hence amortizing), resizing when necessary.
 *     - Insertion or removal of elements NOT at the end is linear in the
 *       distance to the end of the vector, O(n).
